Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Broadside Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.",

      pairingText:
        "Salmon can be paired with Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Hartford Court Russian River Pinot Noir ( half-bottle). Reviewers quite like it with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 22 dollars per bottle.",

        "Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc are my top picks for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Calista Coast Range Pinot Noir with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.",

        "Fish Fillets can be paired with Pinot Noir, Sparkling Wine, and Pinot Grigio. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or GrÃ¼ner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is King Estate Domaine Pinot Noir. It has 4.6 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 50 dollars.",

        "Salad works really well with Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, and Gruener Veltliner. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. One wine you could try is Vie di Romans Chardonnay. It has 4.9 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 36 dollars.",
