      "Preheat oven to 400F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone mats.\nCut off both ends of the plantains. Make a cut along the entire length of a plantain, and peel off the skin.\nSlice each plantain into thin slices. Dont worry if the slices are not perfect.\nPlace the plantains in a medium-sized bowl. Mix in all the other ingredients and stir until everything is well incorporated.\nPlace the plantain slices on the baking sheets in a single layer.\nBake for about 15-20 minutes, flipping them at about the 8- or 9-minute mark. Because of the uneven heat distribution in my oven, I also like to swap the baking sheets between the top and bottom racks.\nRemove the chips from the oven when the edges turn into a nice golden brown color.",

    instructions:
      "Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Set aside.In the bowl of your stand mixer, with paddle attachment fixed (or a handheld electric mixer may be used), combine the cream cheese, blueberry jam, 2 tablespoons of confectioner's sugar, flour, salt and  teaspoon of almond extract. Mix until smooth, about 30 seconds. Set aside.Lay your crescent roll wedges out on a large work surface. Take about a tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture and dollop it on the wide end of each crescent roll. Roll them up until the narrow end is sealed underneath. Transfer them to the prepared baking sheet and brush them with the egg wash. Sprinkle with turbinado sugar.Place the crescent rolls in the oven and bake for 13-15 minutes, or until puffed and golden. Remove from heat and transfer to a wire rack to cool.While the crescent rolls are cooling, prepare your glaze. In a medium bowl, combine the remaining  cup of confectioner's sugar, remaining  teaspoon of almond extract, and milk. Whisk until smooth. Adjust seasoning by adding a pinch of sea salt if you find that the glaze is too sweet. Drizzle the glaze on the slightly cooled crescent rolls and serve immediately. Enjoy!",

      "Preheat your oven (*ding, this is a great toaster oven candidate) to 350F.  Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nWash the endive and remove any unsightly outer leaves.  Slice each endive head in half from the stem to the tip.  Arrange the endive cut side up on the foil-lined baking sheet.  Coat the endive generously with olive oil.  Bake at 350F for 30 minutes, or until the outer edges are golden brown.\nMeanwhile, fry the prosciutto in a skillet until crispy.  Drain onto paper towels, then crumble the prosciutto and set it aside.\nWhen the endive is done roasting, arrange three pieces on a plate alongside a handful of sliced dried figs and pistachio nuts.  Drizzle a spoonful of honey over the plate, then sprinkle the endive with about 1/4th of the crumbled prosciutto.",
